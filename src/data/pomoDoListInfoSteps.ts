    description: `The Pomodoro technique breaks work into short, focused sessions, followed by intentional breaks.

      This approach helps you:

        - Avoid mental fatigue

        - Reduce procrastination

        - Stay engaged for longer periods

        You work with your brain, not against it.

        Working without a clear task leads to wasted time.

        With PomoDoList, every Pomodoro session is tied to a specific task, so you always know:

        - What you’re working on

        - Why it matters

        - When it's done

        Focus becomes measurable progress.
